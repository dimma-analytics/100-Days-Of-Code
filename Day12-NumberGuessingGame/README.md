# 🎯 Day 12 – Number Guessing Game  

This is my twelfth mini project from the **100 Days of Code: Python Bootcamp**.  

I built a fun **Number Guessing Game** where the player tries to guess a randomly generated number. Unlike some past projects, I coded this one **entirely from scratch** without leaning on the instructor’s solution — and it felt amazing! 🚀

## 🛠 Tools Used  
- **Python** (`functions`, `if/else`, `while loops`, `random`, `scope`)  
- **Visual Studio Code**  

---

## 💡 What It Does  
- Generates a random number within a set range  
- Lets the player choose a difficulty level (easy/hard)  
- Gives the player a limited number of lives based on difficulty  
- Provides feedback if the guess is too high or too low  
- Ends the game when the player guesses correctly or runs out of lives  

---

## 🧠 What I Practiced  
- Understanding **scope** (local vs global variables)  
- Writing cleaner functions to organize game logic  
- Managing game flow using **loops and conditionals**  
- Using constants and naming conventions  
- Building confidence by solving the entire project solo ✨
