# 🏆 Day 9 – Blind Auction  

This is my ninth mini project from the **100 Days of Code: Python Bootcamp**.  

I built a simple command-line program that runs a blind auction. It collects bids from multiple participants and determines the winner without revealing other bids until the end. This was a great way to practice dictionaries, nesting, and functions in Python.

## 🛠 Tools Used  
- **Python** (`input()`, `print()`, dictionaries, loops, functions, nesting)  
- **Visual Studio Code**  

---

## 💡 What It Does  
- Accepts user input for bidder names and their bid amounts  
- Stores bids securely inside a dictionary  
- Keeps the auction “blind” by clearing the screen after each entry  
- Determines the highest bidder at the end and announces the winner  

---

## 🧠 What I Practiced  
- Creating and updating **dictionaries**  
- **Nesting data structures** (dicts in lists, lists in dicts, etc.)  
- Using **functions** with dictionary inputs/outputs  
- Iterating through dictionaries to find max values  
- Writing cleaner, modular code
