# 🐍 Day 25 – Nigerian States Game

This is my twenty-fifth mini project from the **100 Days of Code: Python Bootcamp**.  

In this project, I created a **Nigerian States Game**. The game challenges players to correctly name all 36 Nigerian states plus the FCT, displaying their locations on the map as they guess them.

## 🛠 Tools Used  
- **Python** (`turtle`, `pandas`)  
- **Visual Studio Code**  

---

## 💡 What It Does  
- Displays a **map of Nigeria** as the game board  
- Prompts the player to **type the name of a Nigerian state**  
- Places the state name on the map at its **approximate `(x, y)` coordinates** once guessed correctly  
- Tracks **which states have been guessed** and which are **missing**  
- Allows the player to **exit at any time** and see a list of **states they missed** for later study  

---

## 🧠 What I Practiced  
- Reading and managing data with **pandas** (`.csv` files for states and coordinates)  
- Using **Turtle graphics** to dynamically write state names on a map  
- Handling **user input and conditional logic** for game interactions  
- Applying **loops and data-driven logic** to track correct and missing guesses  
- Customizing an existing project to reflect **local geography and culture**

## 🎯 Future Enhancements  
- Add a **quiz mode** for states by region  
- Implement a **timer or score system** to make it more challenging  
- Include **hints** for state locations or first letters
