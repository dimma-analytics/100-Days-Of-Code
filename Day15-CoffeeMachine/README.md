# ☕ Day 15 – Coffee Machine  

This is my fifteenth mini project from the **100 Days of Code: Python Bootcamp**.  

I built a **Coffee Machine Simulation**, where the program acts like a real coffee machine. It lets the user choose a drink, processes the payment, checks resources, and serves coffee until the machine is turned off or runs out of ingredients.

## 🛠 Tools Used  
- **Python** (`functions`, `if/else`, `while loops`, `dictionaries`)  
- **Visual Studio Code**  

---

## 💡 What It Does  
- Displays a menu of drinks (espresso, latte, cappuccino)  
- Checks if there are enough ingredients before making a drink  
- Processes coin input and verifies if enough money is provided  
- Gives change if necessary and serves the drink  
- Can be turned off with a command  
- Provides a report of remaining resources and money in the machine  

---

## 🧠 What I Practiced  
- Using **dictionaries** to store data (menu, ingredients, resources)  
- Writing **functions** to break the program into manageable parts  
- Handling **user input** and validating resources  
- Working with **loops** to keep the machine running until turned off  
- Applying **control flow** to manage complex conditions
