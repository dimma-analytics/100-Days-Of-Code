# 🔐 Day 8 – Caesar Cipher Encryptor

This is my eighth mini project from the **100 Days of Code: Python Bootcamp**.

I built a simple command-line Caesar Cipher app that encrypts or decrypts a message by shifting its letters by a certain number in the alphabet. This was a fun way to practice function inputs and string manipulation.

## 🛠 Tools Used
- **Python** (`input()`, `print()`, `for`, `if/elif/else`, string slicing, `.index()`, `%`, `.lower()`)
- **Visual Studio Code**

---

## 💡 What It Does
- Accepts user input for the message, direction (encode/decode), and shift number
- Applies Caesar Cipher logic to either encrypt or decrypt the message
- Repeats the process until the user chooses to exit

---

## 🧠 What I Practiced
- Writing **functions with multiple parameters**
- Understanding **positional vs keyword arguments**
- Making reusable, clean code through modularization
- Handling user inputs with conditionals and loops
- Thinking about **code elegance** vs just functionality
