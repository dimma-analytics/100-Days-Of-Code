# 💌 Day 32 – Birthday Wisher (Automated Email Sender)

This is my thirty-second mini project from the **100 Days of Code: Python Bootcamp**.

In this project, I built a **Birthday Wisher** that automatically sends personalized birthday emails to friends or family members. It reads data from a birthday list, chooses a random message template, personalizes it with the recipient’s name, and delivers it straight to their inbox — all automatically!

## 🛠 Tools Used
- **Python** (`smtplib`, `datetime`, `random`, `pandas`)
- **Gmail SMTP Server**
- **Visual Studio Code**

---

## 💡 What It Does
- Reads birthday data from a `.csv` file  
- Checks if **today’s date** matches any birthday in the dataset  
- Picks a **random letter template** and personalizes it with the recipient’s name  
- Sends the email automatically through Gmail’s SMTP server  
- Can be automated to run daily using a task scheduler or cloud platform  

---

## 🧠 What I Practiced
- Sending emails securely with **SMTP** and **TLS encryption**  
- Using **Gmail App Passwords** for secure authentication  
- Working with **datetime** to detect today’s date  
- Reading and filtering data from CSV files using **Pandas**  
- Automating repetitive tasks with Python
