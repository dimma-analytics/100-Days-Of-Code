# 🐍 100 Days of Code – Python Challenge
Welcome to my 100-day Python learning journey! Every day, I’ll be solving beginner-to-intermediate challenges and building mini projects to sharpen my skills. Each folder below contains the code, screenshots, and notes for that day’s work.

## 📅 Projects by Day

---

### 🎯 [Day 14 – Higher or Lower Game](./Day14-HigherOrLowerGame)  

- **Mini Project:** A Higher or Lower game where the player guesses which celebrity/account has more followers.  
- **Tools Used:** Python, functions, conditionals, loops, random module, dictionaries  
- **What it Does:** Displays two accounts for comparison, asks the player to choose, tracks the score for correct guesses, and ends the game when the player guesses wrong.  
- **What I Practiced:** Working with dictionaries and lists, organizing code with functions, combining multiple concepts (randomization, scope, loops, conditionals), and structuring logic for readability and reusability.  

---

### 🎯 [Day 13 – Debugging Practice](./Day13-Debugging)  

- **Mini Project:** Debugging exercises to identify and fix broken Python code.  
- **Tools Used:** Python, print statements, error messages, logic tracing  
- **What it Does:** Focuses on finding and fixing common errors such as `IndentationError`, `TypeError`, `IndexError`, and `KeyError`.  
- **What I Practiced:** Reading error messages, using print statements for debugging, identifying logic errors, applying rubber duck debugging, and building a structured problem-solving mindset.  

---

### 🎯 [Day 12 – Number Guessing Game](./Day12-NumberGuessingGame)  

- **Mini Project:** A number guessing game where the user tries to guess a randomly generated number.  
- **Tools Used:** Python, functions, conditionals, loops, random module, scope  
- **What it Does:** Generates a random number, lets the player choose difficulty, gives limited lives, provides feedback (too high/too low), and ends when the number is guessed or lives run out.  
- **What I Practiced:** Understanding scope (local vs global variables), using constants, managing game flow, organizing logic with functions, and building confidence by solving the project independently.  

---

### 🃏 [Day 11 – Blackjack Game](./Day11-BlackjackGame)

- **Mini Project:** A simple Blackjack card game where the user plays against the computer.  
- **Tools Used:** Python, functions, return statements, loops, conditionals, random module  
- **What it Does:** Deals cards, calculates scores using Blackjack rules, lets the player draw or pass, and compares scores to determine the winner.  
- **What I Practiced:** Breaking down big projects into smaller steps, using functions with returns, handling multiple conditions, and structuring game logic.  

---

### 🧮 [Day 10 – Calculator](./Day10-Calculator)

- **Mini Project:** A command-line calculator that performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.  
- **Tools Used:** Python, functions, loops, return statements  
- **What it Does:** Lets the user choose an operation, inputs numbers, returns the result, and allows continuous calculations until the user decides to quit.  
- **What I Practiced:** Creating functions with outputs, reusing return values, building modular reusable code, and looping for continuous calculations.  

---

### 🏆 [Day 9 – Blind Auction](./Day9-BlindAuction)

- **Mini Project:** A command-line blind auction app that collects secret bids and announces the winner.
- **Tools Used:** Python, dictionaries, loops, functions, nesting
- **What it Does:** Stores bids in a dictionary, keeps the auction “blind” by clearing the screen after each entry, and determines the highest bidder
- **What I Practiced:** Creating & updating dictionaries, nesting data structures, looping through dicts, modularizing code with functions

---

### 🔐 [Day 8 – Caesar Cipher Encryptor](./Day8-CaesarCipher)

- **Mini Project:** A Caesar Cipher tool that encrypts or decrypts text using letter shifting logic.
- **Tools Used:** Python, input/output functions, string manipulation, loops, conditionals
- **What it Does:** Encrypts or decrypts messages based on user input and a shift number
- **What I Practiced:** Functions with parameters, keyword arguments, clean reusable logic, modular thinking

---

### 📊 [Day 7 – Python Budget Tracker App](./Day7-BudgetTracker)

- **Mini Project:** A simple command-line finance tracker that helps users manage income and expenses directly from the terminal.
- **Tools Used:** Python, loops, conditionals, lists, string formatting, user input
- **What it Does:** Allows users to track income and expenses, view a summary, and list all transactions — with real-time balance updates
- **What I Practiced:** `while` loops, list tracking, variable updates, menu-driven CLI design, and clean user interaction
  
---

### 📝 [Day 6 – CLI To-Do List App](./Day6-ToDoList) 
 
  - **Mini Project:** A simple command-line task manager that lets users add, view, mark as done, and delete tasks directly in the terminal.
  - **Tools Used:** Python, functions, while loops, lists of dictionaries, input validation
  - **What it Does:** Manage tasks in a continuous menu with clear feedback and error handling
  - **What I Practiced:** Function structure, loops, `enumerate()`, `.isdigit()`, range checks, and data management in lists of dictionaries

--- 

### 🔐 [Day 5 – Password Generator + Evaluator](./Day5-StrongPasswordTool) 
 
  - **Mini Project:** A tool that generates secure passwords and checks password strength based on letter, number, and symbol inclusion.
  - **Tools Used:** Python, random module, string methods
  - **What it Does:** Generate a secure password, check the strength of an existing one
  - **What I practiced:** Randomization, string manipulation, user feedback

---

### 🟣 [Day 4 – Magic 8-Ball](./Day4-Magical8Ball)

- **Mini Project:** A playful fortune-telling program that responds to user questions with randomly selected answers.
- **Tools Used:** Python, Visual Studio Code, GitHub Desktop.
- **What it Does:** Prompts the user to ask any yes/no question, then returns a randomized, dramatic answer. Loops until the user chooses to stop.
- **What I practiced:** Practiced working with lists, random.choice(), string cleanup with `.strip()` and `.lower()`, and designing interactive while loops.

---

### 🩺 [Day 3 – Medical Triage Assistant](./Day3-MedicalTriageAssistant)  
A logic-based assistant that offers basic health triage based on symptoms like fever, cough, chest pain, and exposure risk.  
**Tools used:** Python, Input/Output, Control Flow, Logical Operators
