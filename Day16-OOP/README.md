# 🏗️ Day 16 – Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)  

This is my sixteenth milestone from the **100 Days of Code: Python Bootcamp**.  

Today marked the beginning of the **intermediate level** of the course, where I was introduced to the concepts of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** in Python.  

---

## 🛠 Tools Used  
- **Python** (classes, objects, methods, attributes, constructors)  
- **PrettyTable** package (for practicing with external libraries)  
- **Turtle** graphics (exploring OOP in built-in modules)  
- **Visual Studio Code**  

---

## 💡 What I Learned  
- The difference between **procedural programming** and **object-oriented programming**  
- How to create and use **classes** as blueprints  
- Building and working with **objects** (instances of a class)  
- Understanding **attributes** (data/properties) and **methods** (functions/actions)  
- The role of the `__init__()` constructor method in object creation  
- How to explore OOP in Python’s built-in modules (like `turtle`)  
- Installing and using third-party packages (`prettytable`)  
- How to read and understand **documentation** for classes and methods  

---

## 📂 Mini Practice Projects  
- Created simple classes (`Dog`, `Car`) to understand attributes and methods  
- Used `PrettyTable` to build and display a formatted table  
- Explored `turtle` graphics by creating objects (`Turtle`, `Screen`) and calling their methods  

---

## 🔑 Key Takeaway  
OOP may feel overwhelming at first, but it’s a powerful way to **organize code, group related data and functions together, and build scalable projects**. It’s like moving from writing step-by-step instructions to designing **blueprints that can generate multiple objects**.
