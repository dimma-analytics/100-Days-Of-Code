# 🎨 Day 18 – Hirst Painting  

This is my eighteenth mini project from the **100 Days of Code: Python Bootcamp**.  

I recreated a **Hirst Spot Painting** using Python’s `turtle` graphics module. The program generates a grid of colorful dots inspired by artist Damien Hirst’s famous spot paintings. Each dot is randomly selected from a color palette extracted from an image, creating a vibrant and unique artwork every time the program runs.

## 🛠 Tools Used  
- **Python** (`turtle`, `colorgram`)  
- **Visual Studio Code**  

---

## 💡 What It Does  
- Extracts color palettes from an image using the `colorgram` library  
- Draws a grid of evenly spaced colorful dots using `turtle`  
- Randomly selects colors for each dot to mimic modern art style  
- Produces a visually appealing artwork each time it runs

## 🧠 What I Practiced  
- Using the **turtle graphics** library for creative drawing  
- Working with **RGB color tuples** and randomization  
- Extracting and manipulating colors using **colorgram**  
- Looping through **rows and columns** to create structured patterns  
- Understanding **Python’s coordinate system** in graphical applications
