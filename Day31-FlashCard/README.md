# 🧮 Day 31 – Flashcard App  

This is my thirty-first mini project from the **100 Days of Code: Python Bootcamp**.  

In this project, I built a **Flashcard App** that helps users study and memorize vocabulary in a fun, interactive way. It automatically flips cards to reveal translations after a few seconds and lets users track which words they’ve learned — a perfect blend of productivity and creativity!

## 🛠 Tools Used  
- **Python** (`tkinter`, `pandas`, `random`)  
- **Visual Studio Code**  

---

## 💡 What It Does  
- Displays **flashcards** showing a word in one language (e.g., French)  
- Automatically **flips** to show the translation after a few seconds  
- Allows users to **mark words as learned**, updating the dataset automatically  
- Saves progress to a `.csv` file so users can continue learning later  
- Features a **beautiful and simple GUI** using `tkinter`  

---

## 🧠 What I Practiced  
- Building **interactive GUIs** with `tkinter`  
- Using **Pandas** for reading and updating CSV data  
- Implementing **event-driven programming** with timers  
- Random selection and **data manipulation**  
- File handling and persistent data storage
