# ðŸ“Œ Day 6 â€“ CLI To-Do List App  

This is my sixth mini project from the **100 Days of Code: Python Bootcamp**.  
I built a simple **Command-Line Interface (CLI)** To-Do List application to practice **functions, lists, conditionals, and loops**.  
The app lets users manage their tasks directly from the terminal â€” adding, viewing, marking as done, and deleting tasks â€” with input validation and clean feedback.

---

## ðŸ›  Tools Used
- Python (`input()`, `print()`, `if/elif/else`, `while`, `for`, `enumerate()`, `.isdigit()`, `.strip()`, `append()`, `pop()`)
- Visual Studio Code

---

## ðŸ’¡ What It Does
The app gives users 5 menu options:

1. **Add task** â€“ Create a new task stored in a list as a dictionary (`{"title": ..., "done": False}`)  
2. **View tasks** â€“ See all tasks, numbered, with `[ ]` for incomplete and `[x]` for completed  
3. **Mark task as done** â€“ Change a taskâ€™s status from incomplete to complete  
4. **Delete task** â€“ Remove a task from the list  
5. **Exit** â€“ Close the program

**Extra features**:
- Validates inputs (e.g., rejects letters where numbers are expected)
- Handles out-of-range task numbers gracefully
- Keeps running until the user chooses to exit

## ðŸ§  What I Learned
- How to structure a Python CLI app using **functions** for each feature  
- How to use a **while loop** for continuous menu display  
- How to store and manage data with **lists of dictionaries**  
- How to perform **input validation** using `.isdigit()` and range checks  
- How to use **enumerate()** to display numbered lists starting at 1  
- The value of reusing functions (e.g., `view_tasks()` inside other features)
