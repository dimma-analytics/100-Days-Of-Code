# 🃏 Day 11 – Blackjack Game  

This is my eleventh mini project from the **100 Days of Code: Python Bootcamp**.  

I built a simple **Blackjack Game** that simulates playing cards between a user and the computer. This project was a **capstone day** for everything I’ve learned so far, and honestly, it stretched me mentally. I ended up using the instructor’s solution, but I learned a lot by studying how the logic flows.

## 🛠 Tools Used  
- **Python** (`functions`, `return`, `if/else`, `while loops`, `random`)  
- **Visual Studio Code**  

---

## 💡 What It Does  
- Deals random cards to both the player and computer  
- Calculates scores using Blackjack rules (with Ace counting as 1 or 11)  
- Lets the player choose to draw more cards or pass  
- Determines a winner by comparing scores  
- Handles edge cases like Blackjack and going over 21  

---

## 🧠 What I Practiced  
- Using **functions with return values** to calculate scores  
- Applying **loops and conditionals** to control game flow  
- Implementing **game logic** step by step  
- Handling multiple conditions in a clean, structured way  
- Understanding how to break down a big project into smaller parts
