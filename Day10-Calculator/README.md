# 🏆 Day 10 – Calculator  

This is my tenth mini project from the **100 Days of Code: Python Bootcamp**.  

I built a simple command-line **Calculator** that can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. What makes this project special is that it uses **functions with outputs (`return`)** to send results back, making the code reusable and more powerful.  

---

## 🛠 Tools Used  
- **Python** (`input()`, `print()`, `return`, loops, functions)  
- **Visual Studio Code**  

---

## 💡 What It Does  
- Lets the user choose an operation (+, -, ×, ÷)  
- Takes two numbers as input  
- Returns the result using `return` instead of just printing  
- Allows continuous calculations by carrying forward previous results  
- Ends when the user decides to exit  

---

## 🧠 What I Practiced  
- The difference between **`print()` vs `return`**  
- Creating **functions with outputs**  
- Passing return values into other functions  
- Writing modular and reusable code  
- Building a loop to keep the calculator running until the user quits
