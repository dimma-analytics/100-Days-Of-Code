# 🚗 Day 2 – Bolt Driver Profit Calculator 💰

This is my second mini project from the **100 Days of Code: Python Bootcamp**. I built a **Bolt Driver Profit Calculator** — a handy tool for ride-hailing drivers in Nigeria to quickly estimate **profits or losses** from trips based on **fuel usage, fare, commission, and expenses**.

### 🛠️ Tools Used
- Python (basic arithmetic operations, input/output)
- Visual Studio Code

---

### 💡 What It Does
The program takes the following user inputs:

- 🛣️ Trip distance (in kilometers)  
- ⛽ Fuel price (₦/liter)  
- 🛻 Fuel consumption (km per liter)  
- 🚖 Fare charged for the trip (₦)  
- 💼 Bolt commission (as a percentage)  
- 🧾 Miscellaneous expenses (₦)

It calculates:

- ⛽ Fuel used and cost  
- 💸 Bolt commission amount  
- 💰 Total expenses  
- 📊 Profit or loss from the trip
