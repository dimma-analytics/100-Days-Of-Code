\# Day 2 – Bolt Driver Profit Calculator 🚗💰



This is my second mini project from the 100 Days of Code: Python Bootcamp. I built a Bolt Driver Profit Calculator — a handy tool for ride-hailing drivers to quickly estimate profits or losses from trips based on fuel usage, fare, commission, and expenses.

\### 🛠️ Tools Used

\- Python (basic arithmetic operations, input/output)

\- Visual Studio Code



---



\### 💡 What It Does

The program takes the following user inputs:

\- Trip distance (km)

\- Fuel price (₦/liter)

\- Fuel consumption (km per liter)

\- Fare charged for the trip (₦)

\- Bolt commission (percentage)

\- Miscellaneous expenses (₦)



It calculates:

\- Fuel used and cost

\- Bolt commission amount

\- Total expenses

\- Profit or loss from the trip
