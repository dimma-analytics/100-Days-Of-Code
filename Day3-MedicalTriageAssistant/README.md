# 🩺 Day 3 – Medical Triage Assistant

This is my third mini project from the 100 Days of Code: Python Bootcamp.  
I built a Medical Triage Assistant — a simple logic-based tool that provides medical advice based on user symptoms like fever, cough, chest pain, and exposure risk.

---

### 🧰 Tools Used
- Python (input/output, logical operators, control flow)
- Visual Studio Code

---

### 💡 What It Does
The program collects basic user health information:
- Age
- Fever (yes/no)
- Cough (yes/no)
- Shortness of breath (yes/no)
- Chest pain (yes/no)
- Recent travel or contact with a sick person (yes/no)

It then provides a triage recommendation:
- 🚨 Go to emergency room
- ⚠️ Visit a clinic within 24 hours
- 🕊️ Monitor symptoms at home

### 📘 What I Learned
- How to use conditional logic to simulate real-world decision-making
- When to use `if`, `elif`, and `else` properly
- How to handle different types of input (string vs integer)
- Structured output formatting for better user experience
