# ⏰ Day 28 – Study Buddy (Pomodoro Timer)

This is my twenty-eighth mini project from the **100 Days of Code: Python Bootcamp**.  

In this project, I built a **Pomodoro Timer App** using **Tkinter** — a productivity tool that helps maintain focus during study or work sessions by alternating between work and break intervals.

---

## 🛠 Tools Used  
- **Python** (`tkinter`, `math`)  
- **Visual Studio Code**  

---

## 💡 What It Does  
- Implements the **Pomodoro Technique** — 25 minutes of focused work followed by short and long breaks  
- Displays a **visual timer** with a tomato-themed UI  
- Automatically switches between **work sessions** and **breaks**  
- Keeps track of the number of completed **Pomodoro cycles**  
- Updates the title label dynamically to show whether it’s “Work” or “Break” time  

---

## 🧠 What I Practiced  
- Using **Tkinter** to design and manage a GUI window  
- Implementing **after()** to schedule function calls for the countdown timer  
- Managing **global variables** for session tracking  
- Working with **modulus logic** (`%`) to alternate between work, short break, and long break intervals  
- Applying **math.floor()** and string formatting to control how time displays on screen
