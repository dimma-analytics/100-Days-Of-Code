# 🐞 Day 13 – Debugging Practice  

This is my thirteenth milestone from the **100 Days of Code: Python Bootcamp**.  

Unlike the previous days where I built projects, today’s focus was entirely on **debugging skills** — learning how to find, understand, and fix errors in Python.  

---

## 🛠 Tools Used  
- **Python** (`print()` debugging, error messages, logic checks)  
- **Visual Studio Code**  

---

## 💡 What I Practiced  
- Reading and interpreting **error messages** (IndentationError, TypeError, IndexError, KeyError)  
- Using **print statements** to trace code execution  
- Identifying and fixing **logic errors**  
- Applying problem-solving strategies like *rubber duck debugging*  
- Building patience and a systematic approach to solving bugs
