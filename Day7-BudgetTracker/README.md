# 📌 Day 7 – Python Budget Tracker App

This is my seventh mini project from the **100 Days of Code: Python Bootcamp**.

I built a simple **command-line Budget Tracker** that helps users track income and expenses, view summaries, and manage personal finances — all from the terminal. It was a great way to practice loops, conditional logic, user input, and simple data storage.

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- **Python** (`input()`, `print()`, `if/elif/else`, `while`, `for`, `+=`, `lists`, `.append()`, `.lower()`, `.startswith()`, `float()`)
- **Visual Studio Code**

---

## 💡 What It Does

The app gives users 5 menu options:

1. **Add Income** – Record new income and update total balance
2. **Add Expense** – Record new expenses and subtract from balance
3. **View Summary** – See total income, total expenses, and current balance
4. **View Transactions** – See a history of all incomes and expenses
5. **Exit** – Close the program

## 🧠 What I Learned

- How to build a **menu-based CLI app** with `while` loops
- How to structure code using `if-elif` blocks
- How to collect and update **live user data** with variables
- How to **track state** using multiple variables and lists
- The importance of making apps **user-friendly** with messages and formatting
