# Day 1 – Startup Name Generator 🚀

This is my first mini project from the **100 Days of Code: Python Bootcamp**. I built a simple **Startup Name Generator** that takes two user inputs – a favorite word and an industry – and creates fun, catchy startup names using different combinations.

## 🛠 Tools Used
- Python (basic string manipulation)
- Thonny IDE
- Visual Studio Code 

## 💡 What It Does
The program takes two inputs and generates different startup name variations such as:
- Combining the full words
- Using the first/last few letters
- Mixing them for catchy results

## 📚 What I Learned
- How to take input from users in Python
- String slicing and concatenation
- Writing clean and readable beginner-level code
