# 🔮 Day 4 – Magic 8-Ball

This is my fourth mini project from the 100 Days of Code: Python Bootcamp.  
I built a **Magic 8-Ball Simulator** — a playful digital oracle that takes your yes/no question and delivers a randomized, mysterious response.

---

## 🧰 Tools Used
- Python (`input`, `random.choice`, `.strip()`, `.lower()`, `lists`, `print`)
- Visual Studio Code

---

## 💡 What It Does

The program allows the user to:
- Ask any **yes/no style** question
- Get a **randomly selected answer** from a list of playful, dramatic responses
- Continue asking **as many questions as they want**
- Exit the loop with a simple `yes/no` confirmation

## 📘 What I Learned
- How to use `random.choice()` to simulate unpredictability  
- How to use `.strip()` and `.lower()` for clean user input  
- Creating a `while` loop that respects user exit conditions  
- Formatting output to be interactive and fun
