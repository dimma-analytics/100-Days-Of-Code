# 🔤 Day 26 – NATO Phonetic Alphabet Project  

This is my twenty-sixth mini project from the **100 Days of Code: Python Bootcamp**.  

In this project, I created a **NATO Phonetic Alphabet Converter**. It takes any word a user types and converts each letter into its corresponding **NATO phonetic code word** (e.g., “A” → “Alpha”, “B” → “Bravo”).

## 🛠 Tools Used  
- **Python** (`pandas`)  
- **Visual Studio Code**  

---

## 💡 What It Does  
- Reads data from a `.csv` file containing all **NATO phonetic codes**  
- Uses **dictionary comprehension** to create a key-value pair of letters and code words  
- Accepts a **user input** (word or name)  
- Converts each letter in the input into its **phonetic equivalent**  
- Displays the resulting list of phonetic code words  

---

## 🧠 What I Practiced  
- **List and Dictionary Comprehension** for efficient code creation  
- Using **pandas** to read and iterate through `.csv` files  
- Creating dictionaries dynamically using **DataFrame.iterrows()**  
- Handling user input and converting data into structured output  
- Strengthening logic and data transformation skills in Python
