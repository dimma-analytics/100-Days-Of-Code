# 🔐 Day 29 – Password Manager  

This is my twenty-ninth mini project from the **100 Days of Code: Python Bootcamp**.  

In this project, I built a **Password Manager app** that generates strong, random passwords and saves them securely for easy access. It’s a beginner-friendly GUI application that combines creativity with practical everyday use!

## 🛠 Tools Used  
- **Python** (`tkinter`, `pyperclip`, `json`, `random`)  
- **Visual Studio Code**  

---

## 💡 What It Does  
- Generates **strong random passwords** using letters, numbers, and symbols  
- Allows users to **save website, email, and password combinations** locally in a `.json` file  
- Automatically **copies generated passwords to the clipboard** using `pyperclip`  
- Provides a **simple and intuitive GUI** built with `tkinter`  
- Validates user input before saving credentials  

---

## 🧠 What I Practiced  
- Building **Graphical User Interfaces (GUI)** with `tkinter`  
- Working with **JSON files** for data storage and retrieval  
- Using **`pyperclip`** for clipboard operations  
- Generating random data using the **`random`** module  
- Strengthening concepts of **data validation**, **error handling**, and **UI event-driven programming**
