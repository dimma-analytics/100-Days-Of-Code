# 🔐 Day 5 – Password Generator + Evaluator

This is my fifth mini project from the 100 Days of Code: Python Bootcamp.  
I built a **Password Generator and Strength Checker** that helps users either create a secure password or evaluate how strong their current password is — based on character mix and length.

---

## 🧰 Tools Used
- **Python** (`input`, `for` loop, `if/elif`, `len()`, `isalpha()`, `isdigit()`, `isalnum()`, `random.choice()`, `random.shuffle()`)
- **Visual Studio Code**

---

## ⚙️ What It Does

This tool gives users two options:

### ✅ Option 1: Generate a strong password
- User chooses how many letters, symbols, and numbers they want
- The app creates a randomized, secure password
- Automatically evaluates the strength based on length and character diversity

### 🔍 Option 2: Check strength of your own password
- User pastes their current password
- The tool checks for:
  - Total length
  - Presence of letters, numbers, and symbols
- Gives helpful feedback to improve weak passwords

## 🧠 What I Learned

- How to combine **loops, conditionals, and Boolean logic** to analyze strings
- How to use Python’s **random module** for dynamic generation
- Best practices for building tools that mimic real-world use cases
- Reinforced the importance of **clean UX and user feedback** in CLI apps
