# 🏁 Day 19 – Turtle Race  

This is my nineteenth mini project from the **100 Days of Code: Python Bootcamp**.  

I built a fun **Turtle Race** game using Python’s `turtle` graphics module. The program lets users bet on which turtle will win the race, then simulates a colorful and unpredictable competition as the turtles move across the screen at random speeds.

## 🛠 Tools Used  
- **Python** (`turtle`, `random`)  
- **Visual Studio Code**  

---

## 💡 What It Does  
- Displays multiple colored turtles lined up at a starting point  
- Allows the user to **place a bet** on which turtle color will win  
- Moves turtles forward at **random speeds** until one crosses the finish line  
- Declares the winner and checks if the user’s bet was correct  
- Creates a **fun and interactive** experience using the `turtle` module  

---

## 🧠 What I Practiced  
- Using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** with the `turtle` module  
- Creating and managing multiple **objects (turtles)** simultaneously  
- Implementing **user input** and **event-driven logic**  
- Using **loops, conditionals, and randomization** to control program flow  
- Structuring a small project with **clear, reusable code**
