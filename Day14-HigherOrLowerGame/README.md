# ↕️ Day 14 – Higher or Lower Game  

This is my fourteenth mini project from the **100 Days of Code: Python Bootcamp**.  

I built the classic **Higher or Lower Game**, where the player has to guess which celebrity/account has more followers. Each correct guess increases the score, and the game continues until the player makes a mistake.  

---

## 🛠 Tools Used  
- **Python** (`functions`, `if/else`, `while loops`, `random`, `dictionaries`)  
- **Visual Studio Code**  

---

## 💡 What It Does  
- Displays two random accounts for comparison  
- Asks the player to guess who has more followers  
- Awards a point for each correct guess and continues with a new challenge  
- Ends the game when the player guesses wrong and shows their final score  

---

## 🧠 What I Practiced  
- Working with **dictionaries** and **lists of data**  
- Writing **functions** to handle comparisons and game logic  
- Using **loops** to keep the game running until the player loses  
- Combining multiple concepts (randomization, conditionals, scope, loops) into one cohesive project  
- Structuring code for readability and reusability
