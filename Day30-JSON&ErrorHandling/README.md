# 🧩 Day 30 – JSON & Error Handling in Password Manager

This is my thirtieth milestone from the **100 Days of Code: Python Bootcamp**.

Today’s focus was on strengthening the Password Manager project by introducing **JSON data handling** and improving its **error-handling system**. I learned how to make the app more reliable, prevent crashes, and manage data in a structured, scalable way.

## 🛠 Tools Used
- **Python** (`tkinter`, `pyperclip`, `json`, `random`)
- **Visual Studio Code`

---

## 💡 What I Practiced
- Handling **missing or empty JSON files** using `try` / `except` blocks  
- Debugging and resolving the `json.decoder.JSONDecodeError`  
- Managing data using **JSON dictionaries** for easy access and updates  
- Improving app stability with **error-handling logic**  
- Continuing to refine **GUI interactions** in `tkinter`  
- Ensuring smooth user experience even when files or data are unavailable
