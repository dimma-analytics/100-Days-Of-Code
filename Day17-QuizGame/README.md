# üß© Day 17 ‚Äì Quiz Game  

This is my seventeenth mini project from the **100 Days of Code: Python Bootcamp**.  

I built a **Quiz Game** using the principles of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**. The game pulls in a list of questions and allows the user to answer them one by one. It keeps track of the score, checks answers, and displays progress until all questions have been answered.

## üõ† Tools Used  
- **Python** (`class`, `__init__`, `methods`, `attributes`, `loops`, `lists`, `control flow`)  
- **Visual Studio Code**  

---

## üí° What It Does  
- Loads a set of questions and multiple-choice answers  
- Uses **classes** to structure the program into logical parts  
- Prompts the user to answer each question  
- Checks if the answer is correct and updates the score  
- Displays progress throughout the quiz  
- Ends the game and shows the final score when all questions are completed  

---

## üß† What I Practiced  
- Creating and using **classes** and **objects**  
- Writing **constructors** (`__init__`) to initialize class attributes  
- Defining **methods** that perform specific actions within a class  
- Connecting multiple classes to work together seamlessly  
- Using **loops** and **conditionals** to manage quiz flow  
- Organizing code across multiple files for clarity and scalability
